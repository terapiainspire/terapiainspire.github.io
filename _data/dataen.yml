  title: What is Systemic Therapy, Psychoanalysis and Logotherapy?
  detalhes: |
              Systemic Therapy is a therapeutic approach to reflect on the family system and the repetition of behavioral patterns, seeking to overcome limiting beliefs.
              
              Psychoanalysis is especially effective in addressing and resolving deep-rooted traumas in the unconscious, working to integrate past experiences in a meaningful and healing way.
              
              Logotherapy is an existential approach, founded by Viktor Frankl, which understands the human being in his/her physical, psychic, emotional and spiritual dimensions, and has as its guiding principles the search for the meaning of life, despite human suffering.
              
              The Therapy Action Plan aims to promote personal, mental, emotional and spiritual development in high performance. To do this, it is necessary to expand consciousness, self-knowledge and internal transformation and attitudes to achieve success and prosperity, making your life more productive, fulfilled and happy.
